# Claude Spec Workflow

Specification-driven development commands for Claude Code by [TrakRF](https://trakrf.id)

Created by Mike Stankavich ([@mikestankavich](https://github.com/mikestankavich))

## What is this?

A streamlined workflow for turning conversations and ideas into production-ready code using Claude Code. It combines the best practices from context engineering and progressive validation to enable high-quality, AI-assisted development.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Conversation to Spec** - Extract formal specifications from exploratory chats
- ðŸ¤” **Interactive Planning** - Get clarifying questions before implementation
- âœ… **Continuous Validation** - Test and fix as you build, not after
- ðŸ“Š **Pre-release Checks** - Comprehensive validation before creating PRs
- ðŸš€ **Clean Shipping** - Automated archival and git workflow
- ðŸ”§ **Stack Agnostic** - Works with TypeScript, Python, Go, and more via presets

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trakrf/claude-spec-workflow
cd claude-spec-workflow

# Install commands globally
./install.sh

# Initialize a project (optional)
./init-project.sh /path/to/your/project
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trakrf/claude-spec-workflow
cd claude-spec-workflow

# Install commands globally
.\install.ps1

# Initialize a project (optional)
.\init-project.ps1 C:\path\to\your\project
```

## Quick Start

1. **Create a specification**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p spec/active/my-feature
   cp spec/template.md spec/active/my-feature/spec.md
   # Edit spec.md with your requirements
   ```

   See `examples/profile-feature/spec.md` for a complete example.

2. **Generate implementation plan**
   ```
   /plan spec/active/my-feature/spec.md
   ```
   Claude will ask clarifying questions to ensure a solid plan.

3. **Build with validation**
   ```
   /build spec/active/my-feature/
   ```
   Implementation happens with continuous testing and progress tracking.

4. **Check readiness**
   ```
   /check
   ```
   Comprehensive validation ensures your code is PR-ready.

5. **Ship it**
   ```
   /ship spec/active/my-feature/
   ```
   Archives the spec and prepares for pull request.

## Stack Configuration

The workflow adapts to your project's tech stack through `spec/config.md`.

### Quick Setup with Presets

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cd your-project
~/path/to/claude-spec-workflow/init-stack.sh typescript-react-vite
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd your-project
C:\path\to\claude-spec-workflow\init-stack.ps1 typescript-react-vite
```

### Available Presets

**Single-Stack:**
- `typescript-react-vite` - React + TypeScript + Vite + pnpm
- `nextjs-app-router` - Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- `python-fastapi` - Python + FastAPI + pytest
- `go-standard` - Go with standard library or frameworks

**Monorepo:**
- `monorepo-go-react` - Go backend + React/Vite frontend + TimescaleDB

### Custom Configuration

Create your own stack config:
```bash
./init-stack.sh custom  # Creates spec/config.md template
```

Then edit `spec/config.md` with your project's commands:
```yaml
lint:
  command: your-lint-command
  autofix: your-lint-fix-command

test:
  command: your-test-command

build:
  command: your-build-command
```

The commands `/build`, `/check`, and `/ship` automatically use these settings.

### Monorepo Support

For monorepos with multiple tech stacks (like Go backend + React frontend):

1. **Initialize with monorepo preset:**
   ```bash
   ./init-stack.sh monorepo-go-react
   ```

2. **Add workspace metadata to specs:**
   ```markdown
   ## Metadata
   **Workspace**: backend
   **Type**: feature
   ```

3. **Commands auto-detect workspace:**
   ```bash
   /build spec/active/auth/   # Detects backend workspace from spec
   /check                      # Validates all workspaces (database â†’ backend â†’ frontend)
   /check backend              # Validates only backend workspace (faster feedback)
   ```

The system uses workspace-specific validation commands automatically:
- Backend changes use `go test`, `golangci-lint`
- Frontend changes use `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`
- Database changes validate migrations

## Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/spec` | Convert conversation to specification | After exploring an idea interactively |
| `/plan` | Generate implementation plan | When you have a clear spec |
| `/build` | Execute the plan | After plan is approved |
| `/check` | Validate everything | Before creating PR |
| `/ship` | Complete and archive | When ready to merge |

## Workflow Philosophy

1. **Context is King** - Provide comprehensive context for better AI execution
2. **Clarify Before Coding** - Interactive planning prevents false starts
3. **Validate Continuously** - Fix issues immediately, not in a big cleanup
4. **Ship Clean** - Comprehensive checks ensure professional results

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
â””â”€â”€ spec/
    â”œâ”€â”€ active/           # Current features being developed
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature-name/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ spec.md   # Requirements
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md   # Implementation plan (generated)
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ log.md    # Progress tracking (generated)
    â”œâ”€â”€ template.md       # Spec template for new features
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Workflow documentation
    â””â”€â”€ SHIPPED.md        # Archive of completed features
```

## Uninstalling

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1
```

This removes the Claude commands but leaves your project spec directories intact.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Commands not showing up in Claude Code**
- Verify installation path:
  - macOS/Linux: `~/.config/claude/commands/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\claude\commands\`
- Restart Claude Code after installation
- Check file permissions: `ls -la ~/.config/claude/commands/`

**Permission denied errors**
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
- Check directory permissions: `mkdir -p ~/.config/claude/commands`

### Command Execution Issues

**`/plan` or `/build` can't find spec directory**
- Ensure you're in the project root
- Check `spec/` directory exists: `ls -la spec/`
- Run `./init-project.sh` if spec directory is missing

**Commands run out of order**
- Recommended flow: `/spec` â†’ `/plan` â†’ `/build` â†’ `/check` â†’ `/ship`
- If missing plan.md, run `/plan` first
- If missing spec.md, create it or use `/spec`

**Validation commands fail**
- Missing `spec/config.md`: Commands will use defaults
- Check default commands work: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, etc.
- Run `./init-stack.sh <preset-name>` to create config
- Verify commands in config match your project setup

### Git Issues

**Not on a feature branch**
- `/plan` creates a branch automatically
- Or create manually: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
- Never run `/ship` from main/master branch

**Uncommitted changes block `/ship`**
- Commit or stash changes first
- `/ship` requires clean working directory
- Check status: `git status`

### Monorepo Issues

**Workspace not detected**
- Add `Workspace: backend` to spec.md metadata
- Or use explicit flag: `/build spec/active/feature/ --workspace=backend`
- Verify workspace exists in `spec/config.md`

**Wrong commands run for workspace**
- Check `spec/config.md` has correct workspace sections
- Verify workspace-specific validation commands
- Test commands manually in workspace directory

### Configuration Issues

**Config not being read**
- Ensure file is named exactly `spec/config.md` (not `config.yaml`)
- Check file is in project root, not inside spec/active/
- Verify YAML syntax (indentation matters)

**Commands in config don't work**
- Test commands manually first
- Check for typos in command paths
- Verify package.json scripts exist (for npm/pnpm projects)

### Workflow Issues

**Spec too vague, plan is generic**
- Add more specific technical requirements
- Include code examples and patterns
- Reference similar features in your codebase
- Define clear validation criteria

**Build fails validation repeatedly**
- Check linter and test output carefully
- Fix issues incrementally, don't skip validation
- Review log.md for patterns in failures
- Consider if spec needs clarification

**`/check` finds unexpected issues**
- Review code quality patterns in config
- Some warnings are informational only
- Fix critical issues, decide on warnings
- Update config if checks don't fit your workflow

### Cross-Platform Issues

**Windows path errors**
- Use forward slashes in commands: `/plan spec/active/feature/spec.md`
- PowerShell scripts require execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

**Symlink issues on Unix**
- Scripts now handle symlinks correctly (v1.0.0+)
- If issues persist, use absolute paths
