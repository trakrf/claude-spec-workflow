# Ship Feature for Pull Request

## Persona: Tech Lead

**Adopt this mindset**: You are a tech lead preparing work for team review and production deployment. Your strength is **overall coherence** and ensuring the team can understand, review, and maintain this code. You think about documentation, PR story, success metrics, and production impact. You ensure nothing will surprise reviewers or users.

**Your focus**:
- Production readiness and risk mitigation
- Clear documentation and PR narrative
- Success metrics validation
- Team impact and reviewability

---

You are tasked with completing a feature implementation and preparing it for merge.

---
**⚠️  VALIDATION GATES ARE MANDATORY**

This workflow enforces validation gates - not suggestions, but GATES:
- Lint must be clean
- Types must be correct
- Tests must pass
- Build must succeed

If any gate fails: Fix → Re-run → Repeat until pass

Do NOT treat validation as optional. These are blocking requirements.
---

## Input
The user will provide the path to a feature directory (e.g., `spec/active/auth/`).

## Process

1. **Load Configuration**
    - **Read `spec/stack.md`** for validation commands (required)
    - **Detect project type**:
      - **Monorepo**: If `spec/stack.md` contains `## Workspace:` sections
      - **Single-stack**: If `spec/stack.md` has only top-level commands
    - **Detect workspace** (monorepo only):
      - Read `Workspace:` from spec.md metadata in feature directory
      - Detect from file paths in plan.md
    - Identify which validation commands to use from appropriate section

    If `spec/stack.md` not found, show error and stop:
    ```
    ❌ Stack not configured

    This workflow requires stack configuration. Run:
      /path/to/claude-spec-workflow/init-project.sh . [preset]

    This creates spec/stack.md with validation commands.
    Available presets: typescript-react-vite, python-fastapi, go-standard, monorepo-go-react

    Cannot proceed without spec/stack.md.
    ```

2. **Pre-flight Validation Gate Check**
   Run /check first (programmatically):

   **BLOCKING GATES** (MUST pass - cannot ship otherwise):
    - If lint errors: ABORT with "❌ BLOCKING: Fix lint errors first"
    - If type errors: ABORT with "❌ BLOCKING: Fix type errors first"
    - If test failures: ABORT with "❌ BLOCKING: Fix failing tests first"
    - If build failures: ABORT with "❌ BLOCKING: Fix build errors first"

   **QUALITY WARNINGS** (can proceed, but should address):
    - If console.log found: WARN with "⚠️  WARNING: Consider removing console.logs"
    - If TODOs found: WARN with "⚠️  WARNING: Consider addressing TODOs"
    - If skipped tests: WARN with "⚠️  WARNING: Consider enabling skipped tests"
    - If bundle size high: WARN with "⚠️  WARNING: Consider optimizing bundle size"

   **Only proceed if ALL BLOCKING GATES pass.**

3. **ULTRATHINK: Final Coherence and Completeness Check**

   **CRITICAL**: Before finalizing, think deeply about the overall feature.

   **You've now completed**:
   - All implementation tasks from plan
   - All validation gates passed
   - Code cleanup done

   **Spend time analyzing**:
   - Does this implementation actually solve the original problem from the spec?
   - Are all success metrics from spec.md achievable with this code?
   - What documentation needs updating beyond code comments?
   - Are there any rough edges that will confuse users?
   - What would make a reviewer question this PR?
   - Is there anything that works but feels "wrong"?

   **Ask yourself**:
   - If I deployed this to production right now, what would break?
   - What obvious questions will reviewers ask? Can I address them proactively?
   - Are there any TODOs that should be fixed before shipping vs after?
   - Does the commit message accurately reflect what changed?
   - Will the success metrics I'm claiming actually be true?
   - Is there any "clever" code that needs explanation?

   **Think about documentation**:
   - README changes - are they clear for new users?
   - API documentation - are new endpoints/functions documented?
   - Migration guide - does anything break existing usage?
   - Configuration - are new env vars or settings documented?

   **Think about the PR**:
   - What's the story I'm telling in the PR description?
   - What context from the spec should I include?
   - What testing did I do that gives me confidence?
   - What areas might need extra scrutiny from reviewers?

   **Red flags to check**:
   - ❌ Success metrics in spec can't actually be measured - need to revise claims
   - ❌ Breaking changes not documented - will surprise users
   - ❌ "It works on my machine" - did I test the full workflow?
   - ❌ Commit message is vague - reviewers won't understand intent
   - ❌ TODO comments for core functionality - should finish before shipping
   - ❌ Feels rushed or incomplete - take time to polish

   **Output from this step**: Confidence that this feature is production-ready and the PR tells a clear story.

4. **Update Documentation**
   Check if any docs need updating:
    - README.md - new features or setup changes
    - API documentation - new endpoints
    - Configuration docs - new env vars
    - CHANGELOG.md - if it exists

5. **Clean Up Code**
   If /check found minor issues that can be auto-fixed:

   **Read Lint command from `spec/stack.md`:**
   - For monorepo: Use the Lint command from the appropriate `## Workspace:` section
   - For single-stack: Use the top-level Lint command
   - Run with `--fix` flag to auto-correct issues

   **Manual cleanup if needed**:
   - Remove debug console.log statements
   - Remove commented-out code blocks
   - Address any TODO comments for completed work

6. **Commit Changes**

   Use **Conventional Commits** format for semantic versioning:

   **Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

   **Types**:
   - `feat:` - New feature (triggers MINOR version bump)
   - `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers PATCH version bump)
   - `docs:` - Documentation only
   - `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - `perf:` - Performance improvement
   - `test:` - Adding or fixing tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, deps updates

   **Breaking changes**: Add **!** after type (triggers MAJOR version bump)
   - Example: `feat!: redesign authentication API`

   **Examples**: feat(auth), fix(validation), feat(api)!, docs(readme), refactor(store)

   **Commit your changes**: Stage all changes with git add, create conventional commit with appropriate type, scope, and description.

7. **Update Shipped Log**
   Create/append to `spec/SHIPPED.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## {Feature Name}
   - **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
   - **Branch**: feature/{name}
   - **Commit**: {git rev-parse HEAD}
   - **Summary**: {one-line description}
   - **Key Changes**:
     - {major change 1}
     - {major change 2}
   - **Validation**: ✅ All checks passed

   ### Success Metrics
   (Copy from spec.md and mark actual results)
   - ✅ {Metric 1} - **Result**: {actual outcome}
   - ✅ {Metric 2} - **Result**: {actual outcome}
   - ⏳ {Metric 3} - **Result**: To be measured in production
   - ❌ {Metric 4} - **Result**: Did not meet target, needs follow-up

   **Overall Success**: {percentage}% of metrics achieved

   - **PR**: {pending|url}
   ```

   Commit SHIPPED.md update with git add and git commit.

   **Note**: The spec directory (`spec/active/{feature}/`) remains in place through PR review. It will be archived when starting the next feature via `/plan`.

8. **Push Branch**
   Push to remote with git push -u origin.

9. **Create Pull Request**

   Try authentication methods in order until one succeeds:

   **Method 1: GitHub CLI (if available)**
   - Check if gh CLI is installed: `command -v gh`
   - Check if authenticated: `gh auth status`
   - If both true, create PR: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
   - Capture PR URL from output
   - If successful: Update SHIPPED.md, display success, exit

   **Method 2: GH_TOKEN environment variable**
   - Check if GH_TOKEN is set: `[ -n "$GH_TOKEN" ]`
   - Extract repo info: `git remote get-url origin`
   - Parse owner/repo from URL (format: `owner/repo` from `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` or `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`)
   - Get base branch: `git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch'`
   - Call GitHub API with curl POST to create pull request
   - Parse html_url from JSON response
   - If successful: Update SHIPPED.md, display success, exit

   **Method 3: gh config file**
   - Check if ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml exists
   - Extract oauth_token: `grep -A 2 'github.com:' ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml | grep 'oauth_token:' | awk '{print $2}'`
   - If token found, use same curl approach as Method 2
   - If successful: Update SHIPPED.md, display success, exit

   **Method 4: Manual fallback (last resort)**
   - Show clear error message listing all methods tried
   - Provide instructions for gh auth login or setting GH_TOKEN
   - Suggest manual PR creation URL
   - Leave SHIPPED.md with "PR: pending"

   **Success output format** (when PR created):
   ```
   🔍 Checking GitHub authentication...
   ✅ Found: [method that worked - e.g., "GitHub CLI authenticated"]
   🚀 Creating pull request...

   🔗 Pull Request:

     PR #{number}: {url}
     Title: {title}
     State: {state}

   📦 Updated SHIPPED.md with PR URL
   ```

   **Key principles**:
   - Show what you're trying at each step (transparency)
   - Clear success/failure for each method
   - Actionable error messages (tell user exactly how to fix)
   - Only try next method if current one fails
   - Update SHIPPED.md immediately upon success

## Validation Gates Before Ship

**BLOCKING GATES** (Must pass - cannot ship):
- ❌ All tests passing
- ❌ No type errors
- ❌ Lint clean
- ❌ Build successful
- ❌ No uncommitted changes

**QUALITY WARNINGS** (Can have, should address):
- ⚠️  Small bundle size increase
- ⚠️  Non-critical TODOs
- ⚠️  Documentation updates pending
- ⚠️  console.log statements

If any blocking gate fails, you MUST fix before shipping.

## Output Format

Success case:
```
🚀 Feature Shipped Successfully!

📦 Archive Summary:
- Spec archived in commit: {hash}
- Entry added to SHIPPED.md
- Feature directory cleaned

🌿 Git Status:
- Branch: feature/{name}
- Commits: {N} ahead of main
- Pushed to origin

🔗 Pull Request:

  PR #{number}: {url}
  Title: {title}
  State: {state}

✅ Ready for code review!
```

Failure case:
```
❌ Cannot ship - BLOCKING GATES failed

BLOCKING issues found:
- {Issue 1 - e.g., "5 type errors in src/components/"}
- {Issue 2 - e.g., "3 test failures in auth.test.ts"}

These are MANDATORY gates that block shipping:
✅ Lint must be clean
✅ Types must be correct
✅ Tests must pass
✅ Build must succeed

Run /check to see full report
Fix all BLOCKING issues then try /ship again
```

## Error Handling
- If uncommitted changes: Prompt to commit or stash first
- If on main branch: Refuse to ship, must be on feature branch
- If /check BLOCKING GATES fail: Show specific failures and ABORT (cannot ship)
- If /check has warnings only: Show warnings but allow shipping
- If no specs found: Error with path tried

**Remember**: BLOCKING GATES are not negotiable. Fix them before shipping.

## Execution

```bash
# Try csw in PATH first, fall back to project-local wrapper
if command -v csw &> /dev/null; then
    csw ship "$@"
elif [ -f "./spec/csw" ]; then
    ./spec/csw ship "$@"
else
    echo "❌ Error: csw not found"
    echo "   Run install.sh to set up csw globally"
    echo "   Or use: ./spec/csw ship (if initialized)"
    exit 1
fi
```
