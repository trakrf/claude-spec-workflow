# Build Log: Fix /plan Auto-Cleanup Workflow

## Session: 2025-10-14 18:41

Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 8

## Context Loaded
- ✅ spec/README.md - Linear history workflow, cleanup = DELETE
- ✅ spec.md - Requirements for auto-cleanup on /plan
- ✅ plan.md - 8 task breakdown, 85% confidence
- ✅ spec/stack.md - Shell script validation commands

## Validation Commands (from stack.md)
- **Lint**: `find . -name "*.sh" -not -path "*/\.*" -exec shellcheck {} +`
- **Syntax**: `bash -n <file>`
- **Test**: bats (optional, may not be configured)

## ULTRATHINK: Implementation Strategy

**Task Reordering** (for safety):
1. Rename lib/archive.sh → lib/cleanup.sh (foundational)
2. Update ALL sourcing references (prevent breakage)
3. Create new scripts/cleanup.sh
4. Update bin/csw routing
5. Keep scripts/archive.sh (has auto-tagging, different purpose)
6. Update commands/plan.md docs
7. Full validation

**Validation after**: Each task + full sweep after 2, 5, 6
**Commits**: After Task 2, Task 5, Final

### Task 3: Create scripts/cleanup.sh

Completed: 2025-10-14 18:49

Files: commands/plan.md
Status: ✅ Complete

### Task 5: Update bin/csw routing

Status: ✅ Complete

**Commit**: 1a9c0f6 - "feat: add pre-flight cleanup workflow for /plan"

---

### Task 6: Decision on scripts/archive.sh
Status: ✅ Complete
Decision: Keep scripts/archive.sh as-is
Rationale:
- scripts/cleanup.sh - Pre-flight automatic cleanup (new)
- scripts/archive.sh - Manual cleanup with auto-tagging (legacy)
- Different purposes, both useful
- VERSION file exists, auto-tagging may be needed
Completed: 2025-10-14 18:53

---

### Full Validation
Started: 2025-10-14 18:54
Status: ✅ Complete
Results:
- ✅ shellcheck: All files passed (only SC1091 info messages)
- ✅ bash -n: All syntax checks passed
- ✅ Terminology: Only scripts/archive.sh has "archive" (expected)
- ✅ Path references: No spec/active/ remaining in commands/plan.md
Completed: 2025-10-14 18:55
