# Build Log: End-of-Life PowerShell Installation Scripts

## Session: 2025-10-12
Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 12

## Implementation Notes
- Following benefit-focused approach: "We built a better tool by reducing surface area"
- Bash is prerequisite zero - Windows users need bash to run ./install.sh
- No cross-platform testing required at this stage (dogfooding on Ubuntu first)
- Validation strategy: Shellcheck after each bash-related change, visual inspection for docs
