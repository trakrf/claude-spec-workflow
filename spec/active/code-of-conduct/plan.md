# Implementation Plan: Add Code of Conduct
Generated: 2025-10-22
Specification: spec.md

## Understanding

This feature addresses GitHub issue #32 by adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file to the repository root. The implementation is straightforward: copy the Contributor Covenant v2.1 from the trakrf platform repository to maintain organizational consistency. The enforcement email will remain as `admin@trakrf.id` (organizational contact).

**Scope**: Documentation only - no code changes, no subsystem impact.

**Key Decision**: Enforcement email stays as `admin@trakrf.id` per user confirmation.

## Relevant Files

**Reference Source**:
- `/home/mike/platform/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Source file to copy from (Contributor Covenant v2.1)

**Files to Create**:
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines and behavioral expectations (repository root)

**Files to Modify**:
- None

## Architecture Impact
- **Subsystems affected**: None (documentation only)
- **New dependencies**: None
- **Breaking changes**: None

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Copy CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to Repository Root
**File**: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
**Action**: CREATE
**Source**: `/home/mike/platform/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

**Implementation**:
1. Read the source CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md from trakrf platform
2. Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in repository root (`/home/mike/claude-spec-workflow/`)
3. Copy content exactly as-is (enforcement email `admin@trakrf.id` is correct)

**Validation**:
- File exists at repository root
- Content matches source (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- Enforcement email is `admin@trakrf.id`
- File is markdown format with proper structure

### Task 2: Verify GitHub Recognition
**Action**: VERIFY
**Purpose**: Confirm GitHub automatically detects the Code of Conduct

**Implementation**:
1. Use `gh api` to check repository community profile
2. Verify CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is recognized

**Command**:
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/community/profile --jq '.files.code_of_conduct'
```

**Expected Result**: GitHub reports CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is present

**Validation**:
- GitHub API confirms code_of_conduct file exists
- Community health percentage increases

### Task 3: Commit Changes
**Action**: COMMIT
**Purpose**: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to version control

**Implementation**:
1. Stage CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
2. Commit with semantic message following repository conventions

**Commit Message Template**:
```
docs: add Code of Conduct

Add Contributor Covenant v2.1 to establish community guidelines
and behavioral expectations for contributors.

Resolves #32
```

**Validation**:
- File is committed to git
- Commit message follows semantic conventions
- References issue #32

## Risk Assessment

**Risk**: Enforcement email may be incorrect for this repository
**Mitigation**: User confirmed `admin@trakrf.id` is correct organizational contact

**Risk**: File encoding or line ending issues
**Mitigation**: Direct file copy preserves original formatting

**Risk**: GitHub not recognizing the file
**Mitigation**: Task 2 explicitly verifies GitHub detection via API

## Integration Points
- None (documentation file only)

## VALIDATION GATES (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: These are not suggestions - they are GATES that block progress.

For this documentation-only feature:

**Gate 1: File Validation**
- Verify file exists at correct path (repository root)
- Verify content matches source
- Verify enforcement email is correct

**Gate 2: GitHub Recognition**
- Run `gh api` command to confirm GitHub detects the file
- Verify community profile updates

**Gate 3: Git Validation**
- Verify file is committed
- Verify commit message is semantic and references issue #32

**Enforcement Rules**:
- If ANY gate fails → Fix immediately
- Re-run validation after fix
- Loop until ALL gates pass
- After 3 failed attempts → Stop and ask for help

**Note**: Standard validation commands from `spec/stack.md` (lint, typecheck, test) do not apply to markdown documentation files.

## Validation Sequence

After Task 1:
- Verify file exists: `test -f CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md && echo "✅ File exists"`
- Verify content: `wc -l CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (should match source ~130 lines)
- Verify enforcement email: `grep "admin@trakrf.id" CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

After Task 2:
- Run GitHub API check: `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/community/profile --jq '.files.code_of_conduct'`

After Task 3:
- Verify commit: `git log -1 --oneline | grep "Code of Conduct"`
- Verify file in git: `git ls-files CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

## Plan Quality Assessment

**Complexity Score**: 2/10 (LOW)
**Confidence Score**: 10/10 (HIGH)

**Confidence Factors**:
✅ Clear requirements from spec (copy file from known location)
✅ Source file exists and has been read
✅ No code changes required
✅ No subsystem integration
✅ No dependencies
✅ Clarifying question answered (enforcement email confirmed)
✅ Standard GitHub community file with well-known path
✅ Simple validation steps

**Assessment**: Extremely straightforward implementation - copy a documentation file from known source to repository root. No technical complexity or integration challenges.

**Estimated one-pass success probability**: 98%

**Reasoning**: This is a simple file copy operation with no code changes, dependencies, or integration points. The only potential issue would be GitHub not recognizing the file, which is mitigated by explicit API verification in Task 2. The high confidence is based on the simplicity of the task and complete clarity of requirements.
