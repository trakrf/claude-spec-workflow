# Feature: Add Code of Conduct

## Origin
This specification emerged from GitHub issue #32, which identified that the repository is missing a CODE_OF_CONDUCT document. The issue suggests copying from the trakrf platform to maintain organizational consistency.

## Outcome
The repository will have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file that establishes community guidelines and behavioral expectations for contributors, consistent with other organizational repositories.

## User Story
As a project maintainer
I want a Code of Conduct document in the repository
So that contributors understand expected behaviors and reporting procedures for violations

As a potential contributor
I want to see clear community guidelines
So that I know this is a welcoming, professional environment

## Context

**Discovery**: Issue #32 identified the missing CODE_OF_CONDUCT document
**Current**: Repository lacks formal community guidelines
**Desired**: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists in repository root, matching trakrf platform standards
**Organization Standard**: The trakrf platform uses Contributor Covenant v2.1 with enforcement contact at admin@trakrf.id

## Technical Requirements

- Copy CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md from trakrf platform repository
- Place in repository root (standard location for GitHub to recognize it)
- Verify enforcement contact email (admin@trakrf.id) is appropriate for this project
- Consider whether enforcement contact needs to be project-specific or can remain organizational

## Implementation Notes

The trakrf platform CODE_OF_CONDUCT is based on Contributor Covenant v2.1, which includes:
- Pledge and standards for community behavior
- Enforcement responsibilities and scope
- Detailed enforcement guidelines (Correction, Warning, Temporary Ban, Permanent Ban)
- Proper attribution to Contributor Covenant and Mozilla

**Key Decision**: The enforcement email is currently set to `admin@trakrf.id`. Confirm this is the correct contact for this repository or if it needs to be updated.

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists in repository root
- [ ] Content matches trakrf platform version (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- [ ] Enforcement contact email is verified and appropriate
- [ ] GitHub automatically recognizes the Code of Conduct (check repository settings/community tab)
- [ ] File is properly committed to version control

## Conversation References

- **Issue**: GitHub issue #32 - "We are missing a CODE OF CONDUCT document"
- **Guidance**: "We can copy from trakrf platform" (issue description)
- **Discovery**: trakrf platform uses standard Contributor Covenant v2.1 at `/home/mike/platform/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- **Consideration**: Enforcement email may need review to ensure appropriate contact for this specific project

## Out of Scope

- Creating a custom Code of Conduct (using established organizational standard)
- Modifying the core content of Contributor Covenant
- Setting up enforcement procedures (assumes organizational structure handles this)
