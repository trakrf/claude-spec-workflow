# Build Log: Optimize SHIPPED.md Workflow

## Session: 2025-10-15 (Initial Implementation)
Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 7

## Objective
Reorder /ship workflow steps to eliminate double-commit pattern:
- Current: Update SHIPPED.md with "PR: pending" → Push → Create PR → Update SHIPPED.md again
- Target: Push → Create PR → Update SHIPPED.md once with complete info

## Validation Strategy
- Visual review of markdown changes after each task
- Dogfooding test at end (ship this feature with new workflow)
- No shell script changes, so shellcheck not applicable

## Tasks Completed

Files modified: commands/ship.md

Changes made:
- Step 7: Changed from "Update Shipped Log" to "Push Branch"

  - Updated Method 4: Changed from "Leave SHIPPED.md with 'PR: pending'" to "HALT execution with error"
  - Updated success output to indicate proceeding to Step 9
- Step 9: Changed from "Create Pull Request" to "Update Shipped Log"
  - Updated SHIPPED.md template: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` for short hash
  - Moved PR to separate line right after Commit (related data together)
