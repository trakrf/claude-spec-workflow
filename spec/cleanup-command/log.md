# Build Log: `/cleanup` Command

## Session: 2025-10-15T00:35:00Z
Starting task: 1
Total tasks: 3

## Implementation Strategy
Following the plan's approach:
1. Create commands/cleanup.md using commands/spec.md as reference pattern
2. Update commands/plan.md to detect and rename cleanup/merged branch
3. Update README.md with cleanup command and lifecycle updates

Reference patterns:
- commands/spec.md - Command structure (persona, process, execution)
- commands/ship.md - csw execution pattern
- Manual execution from conversation - Proven workflow

Validation strategy:
- Shellcheck after each file
- Syntax validation on bash blocks
- Manual review of markdown rendering

### Task 1: Create commands/cleanup.md
Started: 2025-10-15T00:36:00Z
File: commands/cleanup.md

Implementation:
- Created command following commands/spec.md pattern
- Added persona section (Efficient Solo Developer)
- Implemented 7-step process:
  1. Pre-flight checks (warn on edge cases)
  2. Sync with main
  3. Delete merged branches (all prefixes, not just feature/*)
  4. Create cleanup/merged branch
  5. Delete shipped specs (matched against SHIPPED.md)
  6. Commit cleanup
  7. Success message
- Added characteristics, recovery, error handling sections
- Included csw execution pattern

Changes from plan:
- Added counter variables for better UX feedback
- Added skip logic for spec/backlog/ directories
- Added recovery section for user confidence
- More detailed output messages

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Passed
- Shellcheck warnings expected (embedded bash in markdown, not executable script)
- Syntax valid
- Pattern follows commands/spec.md structure
Completed: 2025-10-15T00:37:00Z

### Task 2: Update commands/plan.md
Started: 2025-10-15T00:38:00Z
File: commands/plan.md (lines 429-492)

Implementation:
- Modified "10. **Git Setup**" section
- Added comprehensive branch detection logic:
  * Detects cleanup/merged and renames to feature/$feature_name
  * Creates new branch from main/master (standard path)
  * Handles already-on-feature-branch cases (same branch OK, different = error)
  * Prompts user if on unknown branch
- Added detailed status messages for each path
- Maintains idempotent behavior (safe if already on correct branch)

Changes from plan:
- Added more detailed error handling for edge cases
- Added "already on feature branch" case (not in original plan)
- More verbose status messages for user feedback

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Passed (embedded bash, SC1091 warnings acceptable)
Completed: 2025-10-15T00:39:00Z

---

### Task 3: Update README.md Documentation
Started: 2025-10-15T00:40:00Z
File: README.md

Implementation:
- Added /cleanup to commands table (line 248)
- Updated lifecycle diagram: added [cleanup] step (line 254)
- Updated cycle description: added step 7 for cleanup (line 285)
- Added "Optional /cleanup step" explanation section (lines 298-302)
  * Solo devs: zero-friction cleanup
  * Team devs: manual cleanup per conventions
  * Everything backed up in git/SHIPPED.md

Changes from plan:
- More detailed backup explanation for user confidence
- Clearer distinction between solo dev and team dev workflows

Status: ✅ Complete
Validation: ✅ Passed
Completed: 2025-10-15T00:41:00Z

## Build Summary
Started: 2025-10-15T00:36:00Z
Completed: 2025-10-15T00:41:00Z
Duration: ~5 minutes

**Files Created**:
- commands/cleanup.md (219 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- commands/plan.md (branch detection logic, ~60 lines)
- README.md (commands table, lifecycle diagram, explanation, ~10 lines)

**Validation Status**: ✅ All tasks passed
- Shellcheck: Expected warnings (embedded bash in markdown)
- Markdown rendering: Verified
- Pattern consistency: Follows existing command structure

**Next Steps**:
1. Commit all changes ✅
2. Push to remote ✅
3. Test the full workflow manually:
   - Ship and merge a feature
   - Run /cleanup
   - Verify cleanup/merged branch created
   - Run /plan
   - Verify branch renamed to feature/new-feature

## Post-Ship Refactoring
Completed: 2025-10-15T01:00:00Z

**Refactor: Consistency with other slash commands**

Changed inline bash blocks to external script:
- Moved ~190 lines of bash from commands/cleanup.md to scripts/cleanup.sh
- Updated commands/cleanup.md to use csw execution pattern (like other commands)
- Simplified commands/plan.md cleanup documentation
- Removed misleading claim that /plan calls scripts/cleanup.sh

**Pattern Achieved**:
- commands/*.md: Prompts and process documentation only
- scripts/*.sh: Actual implementation
- bin/csw: Routes commands to scripts

**Validation**:
- shellcheck: Clean (SC1091 info warnings expected)
- syntax check: Valid
- Consistent with spec, plan, build, check, ship commands

**Commit**: 82f666f - refactor: move /cleanup inline bash to scripts/cleanup.sh
