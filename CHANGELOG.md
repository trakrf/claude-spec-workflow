## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- Core specification-driven development workflow with 5 slash commands:
  - `/spec` - Convert conversations to formal specifications
  - `/plan` - Generate implementation plans with clarifying questions
  - `/build` - Execute plans with continuous validation
  - `/check` - Comprehensive pre-release validation
  - `/ship` - Complete features and prepare pull requests
- Cross-platform installation scripts (Unix .sh + Windows .ps1)
- Project initialization system (`init-project` and `init-stack`)
- Stack configuration presets:
  - TypeScript + React + Vite
  - Next.js App Router
  - Python + FastAPI
  - Go (standard library + frameworks)
  - Monorepo (Go backend + React frontend + TimescaleDB)
- Template system for specs, configs, and documentation
- Example specification: User Profile Editing feature (frontend-focused, accessible)
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- MIT License

### Documentation
- Installation guides for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Quick start guide with step-by-step workflow
- Stack configuration examples for single-stack and monorepo projects
- Workspace-aware validation for monorepo projects
- Contributing guidelines and testing documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added

**Scope Protection & Planning Enhancements**:
- **Automatic complexity assessment** (0-10 scoring) in `/plan` command
  - Evaluates file impact, subsystem coupling, task count, dependencies, and pattern novelty
  - Mandatory split for features scoring >= 6/10
  - Auto-suggests 2-3 phases with individual complexity scores
  - YOLO override requires explicit typed confirmation
- **Mandatory clarifying questions** gate before plan generation
  - Cannot skip - ensures thorough requirement understanding
  - Structured with numbered/lettered lists for easy responses
  - Categorized by: requirements, technical approach, integration, edge cases, testing
- **Quality/confidence scoring** added to implementation plans
  - 1-10 confidence score with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW rating
  - Confidence factors breakdown (clear requirements, similar patterns, uncertainties)
  - Estimated one-pass success probability percentage
- **Relevant Files section** in plan templates
  - Reference patterns (existing code to follow)
  - Files to create (with purposes)
  - Files to modify (with specific changes)

**Validation Gate Enforcement**:
- **Upgraded validation terminology** from "rules" to "MANDATORY GATES"
  - Added ðŸš« NEVER / âœ… ALWAYS enforcement language
  - Explicit BLOCKING vs WARNINGS distinction
  - "Fix â†’ Re-run â†’ Repeat until pass" loop requirement
- **Full test suite gate** before any commit in `/build`
  - BLOCKING requirement - cannot skip
  - Must pass 100% of tests (no "technical debt" rationalization)
  - Build must succeed, types must be clean
- **Code cleanup gate** before final validation
  - Mandatory removal of console.log, debugger, commented code
  - Grep-based verification step
  - Dead code and unused imports cleanup

**Success Metrics & Tracking**:
- **Success Metrics section** added to spec template
  - Measurable criteria defined upfront in spec.md
  - Tracked in SHIPPED.md with actual results
  - Overall success percentage calculation
- **Conventional Commits format** in `/ship` command
  - Detailed examples for feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, chore
  - Breaking change syntax (feat!, fix!)
  - Semantic versioning integration

**Documentation**:
- **Complexity Assessment & Scope Protection** section in README
  - Real-world 3,000-line PR story
  - Detailed scoring methodology
  - Phase split examples with rationale
  - "Why This Matters" explanation for quality-focused developers
- **spec/README.md** reference requirement in `/plan` and `/build`
  - Ensures workflow philosophy is consistently followed

### Changed
- Enhanced `/plan` command with multi-gate workflow:
  1. Load Philosophy (spec/README.md)
  2. Read Specification
  3. Complexity Assessment â†’ WAIT for decision
  4. Ask Mandatory Clarifying Questions â†’ WAIT for answers
  5. Research Codebase
  6. External Research (if needed)
  7. Create Implementation Plan
  8. Git Setup
- Enhanced `/build` command steps:
  - Added spec/README.md loading
  - Added code cleanup step (step 5)
  - Enhanced full test suite requirements (step 6)
  - Renumbered summary report (step 7)
- Enhanced `/ship` SHIPPED.md format with success metrics section
- Upgraded all commands with consistent validation gates terminology

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive complexity assessment examples in README
- Added conventional commit examples in ship.md
- Updated all command documentation with new gate terminology
- Added troubleshooting sections for validation and workflow issues

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Additional stack presets (Rust, Ruby, Java)
- Package manager distribution (Homebrew, npm)
- Integration tests for workflow validation
- Video walkthrough tutorials
- Interactive complexity calculator tool
